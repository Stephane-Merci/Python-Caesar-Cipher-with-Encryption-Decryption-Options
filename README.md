# Introduction:

### Welcome to this Python implementation of a Caesar cipher! This script provides a simple tool for encrypting and decrypting messages using the classic Caesar cipher technique. With user-friendly controls, you can customize the encryption/decryption process and analyze the results easily.

# Getting Started:

## Requirements: This script requires Python 3.x to run. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
## Code Structure: The main code is contained within the caesar.py file.
## Running the Script: Use your terminal to navigate to the script directory and execute python caesar.py.

# Usage:

The script prompts the user for three inputs:

Message: Enter the text you want to encrypt or decrypt.
Key: Specify the shift value for the Caesar cipher.
Case: Choose "0" for encryption and "1" for decryption.
Output:

# Based on your selections, the script displays the following:

Encryption Mode: Displays both the original plain text and the encrypted version.
Decryption Mode: Shows the provided cipher text and the decrypted message.
Example:

# Here's an example of encrypting the message "Hello, World!" with a key of 3:

Enter the message: Hello, World!
Enter the key: 3
Enter 0 for encryption and 1 for decryption: 0
plain text: Hello, World!
encrypted text: Khoor, Zruog!

# Technical Details:

The code utilizes the alphabet string variable to handle character shifts during encryption/decryption.
It applies modular arithmetic to ensure the shifted index stays within the alphabet range.
The script differentiates between upper and lowercase letters while preserving the original case.
Space characters are preserved during the process.

# Beyond the Basics:

This script can serve as a foundation for exploring other cipher techniques in Python.
Consider adding features like command-line argument parsing for automation.
You can integrate error handling and input validation for robust user experience
